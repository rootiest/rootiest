### Hi I'm Rootiest ðŸ‘‹

- Name: Chris (or rootiest)
- he/him
- NH, USA (English)

I'm a software developer and maker.

I'm currently spending most of my time working on
[Klipper](https://klipper3d.org) and
[Voron](https://vorondesign.com) related projects.

My dotfiles are available
[here](https://github.com/rootiest/dotfiles).

My neovim dotfiles are available
[here](https://github.com/rootiest/rootiest-nvim).

I've also designed some PCBs for 3D printers and home automation projects.

Recently I've been working on a Discord bot, which you can see in action on my
[Discord server](http://rootiest.com/discord.html).

Her name is Anna, and she works alongside Elsa to keep
the server running smoothly and provide some fun interaction for my community.
