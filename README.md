### Hi I'm Rootiest ðŸ‘‹

- Name: Chris (or rootiest)
- he/him
- NH, USA (English)

I'm a software developer and maker.

I'm currently spending most of my time working on [Klipper](https://klipper3d.org) and [Voron](https://vorondesign.com) related projects.

I've also designed some PCBs for 3D printers and home automation projects.

Recently I've been working on a Discord bot, which you can see in action on my [Discord server](http://rootiest.com/discord.html).

Her name is Anna, and she works alongside Elsa to keep the server running smoothly and provide some fun interaction for my community.
